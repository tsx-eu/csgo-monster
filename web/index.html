                A smokescreen covered their continuous blinks towards the outskirts of the great kingdom, until the cathedral was the only thing clearly visible. Along the way, they could sense the great shadow of a Dragon, watching their every step. Then, the voices of survivors seeking revenge towards the witch echoed through the destroyed cathedral halls. Others were tending to their wounded, others were trying to collect the Enlightened's burning husk from the great funeral pyre, whilst the archbishop was chanting blessings, leading the flock of peasants as if they were warriors, preparing to battle the mighty dragon...

                        <h3>Aleister</h3>

                        Aleister, the former demonlord, is always looking at others bearing a malefic grin upon his twisted visage, harnessing all the power he can muster as he directs bolts of pure chaos towards his foes.

                        The only place Hecate feels safe is total Darkness, where she envelopes herself and thrives, until it totally consumes her existence. Until that strange familiar odor which vanished, reappears and stabs you - in the Dark.

                        Theregar's smile looks intimidating as it is, yet is amplified by the fel green hue of the enchantments he is preparing: As he deflects his attackers, his foes are enlightened by his immense control of the Shadows...

                        Void claimed all in the Halls of Reflection as Roth rised from the Stone, his voice echoing again in the sultry darkness. His enemies fallen, their eyesight blurred, their powers escaping their body as he consumed their souls...

                The ornate peace of these halls would be shattered now and then by the faint whispers of the Statue of a thousand faces, as the soul fragments collided and the Heroes met in glorious Combat. For them it would always be the first time, until someone's time to be free of this burden would come - then he'd regain consciousness of who he was and what he had to do.
